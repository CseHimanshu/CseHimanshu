## 🚀 About Me

I build **production-grade LLM systems** for enterprise document intelligence and data automation.

Currently working on:
- 🔹 LLM-powered information extraction pipelines  
- 🔹 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- 🔹 Agentic AI workflows for multi-step reasoning  
- 🔹 Scalable AI automation on AWS  

In my current role, I have:
- ⚡ Reduced manual scripting effort by **40%**
- ⚡ Improved document processing speed by **60%**

I focus on designing **reliable, scalable, and evaluation-driven AI systems** — not just calling APIs.
